# Linguistics & Tone Guidelines

## Core Philosophy
HelpRide is a non-profit, community-driven platform. We must minimize the feeling of a commercial transaction or employment relationship.
- **Equality**: Drivers and Riders are equal participants. There is no "service provider" vs "customer" hierarchy.
- **Voluntary**: Rides are "offered" voluntarily by drivers and "requested" by riders.
- **Neutrality**: Avoid terms like "Order" (訂單) or "Booking" which imply payment. Use "Ride" (行程) or "Trip".
- **Friendliness**: The tone should be warm, friendly, and slightly colloquial where appropriate to build community feeling.

## Terminology Dictionary

| Concept | Old / Commercial Term | New / Community Term (English) | New / Community Term (Chinese - HK) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Driver** | Driver (司機) | Driver | **車手** | "司機" implies a job. "車手" is colloquial, friendly, and implies skill/enthusiasm. |
| **The Ride** | Order (訂單) | **Trip** / **Ride** | **行程** | "訂單" implies a paid commercial order. "行程" is neutral (Journey/Trip). |
| **Action: Accept** | Accept Order (接單) | **Accept** | **接** | "接單" is commercial. "接" (Pick up/Accept) is casual and direct. *Note: Button padding must accommodate single char.* |
| **State: Accepted** | Order Accepted (已接單) | **Accepted** | **已接受** | Consistent with "Accept". |
| **History** | Order History (訂單記錄) | **Trip History** | **行程記錄** | Consistent with "Trip". |
| **Passenger** | Passenger / Customer | **Rider** | **乘客** | "Rider" is standard. "乘客" is neutral. |

## Implementation Notes
- **Button Styling**: When using single-character labels like "接", ensure minimum touch targets and visual balance (e.g., wider horizontal padding) are maintained.
